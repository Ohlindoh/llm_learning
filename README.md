## Courses

- [Databricks: Large Language Models: Application through Production](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/databricks-large-language-models-application-through-production)
- [Databricks: Large Language Models: Foundation Models from the Ground Up](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/databricks-large-language-models-foundation-models-from-the-ground-up)
  - **Notes:** I'd recommend taking them in this order. The first course provides a good overview of how to build something useful with an LLM. Second course is much more thorough (need to finish)
- [Deep Learning Short Courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)
  - **Notes:** I've found these really helpful for figuring out how to do something quickly (e.g. get up and running with Langchain) with little filler
- [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
  - **Notes:** The GOAT for technical people trying to learn AI
-[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Professional Program](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program)
  - **Notes:** Looks great, not cheap and has some pre-reqs but looks like one of the best online non-grad degree programs. Looks to be directly from Stanford and not any sort of provider (2U, Emeritus, etc.)

## Reading
- [A16z AI Canon](https://a16z.com/ai-canon/)
  - **Notes:** Pretty self explanatory, should probabaly read through everything on here
- [Large language models, explained with a minimum of math and jargon](https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with)
  - **Notes:** Probably one of the best blog posts I've ever read on AI. It's both thorough and friendly at the same time. It's a real gut check on your understanding of LLMs. Are you able to articulate these concepts the way this author did?

## Podcasts
- [Latent Space](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi22sLVrtmDAxWRlIkEHWP4AA0QFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Flatent-space-the-ai-engineer-podcast-codegen-agents%2Fid1674008350&usg=AOvVaw1diCSuLVCEVR52PFrOOIYt&opi=89978449)
  - **Notes:** Good podcast for keeping up with the latest and greatest in AI/LLMs. I particularly like their foundation episodes
- [Dwarkesh Podcast](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi71uX4rtmDAxUPjokEHSNCAfcQFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fdwarkesh-podcast%2Fid1516093381&usg=AOvVaw0ey-NOUFZ88ccXVDDLl7TC&opi=89978449)
  - **Notes:** Longer form, rapid fire questions with heavy hitter guests (not just AI related but it is a pretty popular topic)

## Security
- [Demystifing LLMs and Threats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gDtOu1_7E)
  - **Notes:** Great broad overview of security for LLMs, find myself rewatching it
- [Not with a Bug, But with a Sticker: Attacks on Machine Learning Systems and What To Do About Them](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Bug-But-Sticker-Learning/dp/1119883989)
  - **Notes:** Very fun, quick, motivating read on security for LLMs
